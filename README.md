Project : STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

### OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to develop a Python program to efficiently track and manage student grades. The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as the letter grade and GPA.

### KEY ACTIVITIES
1. **Designing the System**:
   - Define the structure and functionality of the `StudentGrades` class.
   - Determine how grades will be stored and managed.
   - Plan the user interface for adding and displaying grades.

2. **implementing the class**:
   - Develop the `StudentGrades` class with methods for adding grades, calculating averages, converting grades to GPA and letter grades, and displaying grades.

3. **Creating the User Interface**:
   - Implement a simple command-line interface to interact with the user.
   - Provide options to add grades, display grades, and exit the program.

4. **Handling Input and Output**:
   - Read user inputs for subjects and grades.
   - Ensure that inputs are validated and stored correctly.
   - Display calculated results in a clear and user-friendly manner.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test the program with different inputs to ensure accuracy.
   - Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
   - Ensure that edge cases (e.g., no grades entered) are handled gracefully.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document the code to explain the functionality of different methods and classes.
   - Provide user instructions for running and using the program.

### TECHNOLOGY USED
- **Programming Language**: Python
  - **Core Features**: Used to implement the logic for managing and calculating grades.
  - **Standard Library**: Utilized for basic input/output operations and data structures.
- **Development Environment**:
  - **IDE/Code Editor**: Any Python-compatible IDE or code editor (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook) for writing and testing the code.
- **Version Control**: (Optional but recommended)
  - **Git**: For tracking changes, collaborating with others, and maintaining different versions of the project.
- **Documentation**: Plain text or markdown files to document the code and provide user instructions.
